# AWS Copilot Sample microservices demonstration


This is a reference architecture that shows a containerized Node.js microservices application to using AWS Copilot.

The microservices app was developed from the AWS Sample [here](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecs-nodejs-microservices/tree/master/3-microservices)
The sample has 3 services defined behind an Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB), and we create rules on the ALB that direct requests that match a specific path to a specific service.
So each service will only serve one particular class of REST object, and nothing else. This will give us some significant advantages in our ability to independently monitor and independently scale each service.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have the latest version of the AWS CLI installed and configured before running the deployment script. 

After installing the AWS CLI, simply run the 'aws configure' command once. This setups the default profile in your environment.

If you need help installing and configuring, please follow the link below:

[Installing the AWS CLI ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

[Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

The easiest way is to [create an AWS Cloud9 environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/tutorial-create-environment.html#tutorial-create-environment-console) that comes pre-built with pre-requisites. Just run 'aws configure' once and you are good to go.



## Install AWS Copilot

Installing AWS Copilot is easy. Checkout the [manual instructions](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/getting-started/install/) based on your Operating System in the Copilot Docs.

For Linux x86 (64-bit), use following command :

``` shell
curl -Lo copilot https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/releases/latest/download/copilot-linux && chmod +x copilot && sudo mv copilot /usr/local/bin/copilot && copilot --help
```


## Deploy Sample Application with ONE command only :

To deploy a sample Load Balanced Web Service application with just one command, run the following command :

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecs-cli-sample-app.git demo-app && \ 
cd demo-app &&                               \
copilot init --app demo                      \
  --name api                                 \
  --type 'Load Balanced Web Service'         \
  --dockerfile './Dockerfile'                \
  --port 80                                  \
  --deploy
```

This will clone the AWS sample app, and initiate the deployment of the application. It will take few minutes for it to automatically create basic networking infrastructure, build your docker image, create a repository in Amazon ECR, push the docker image, create the Amazon ECS Clusters, ALB, and finally create tasks. In the end, it will provide you with a URL that points to your deployed sample application.

## Deploy Microservices Application :

In real world, you would have a microservices application to be deployed. Following will walk you through individual commands of Copilot that can deployed individual components of your microservices application, build a release pipeline and showcase how can view logs & health status of your application.

The typical flow of the commands will be based on above architecture.

1. Create the app 
```
copilot app init social-media-app
```

2. Create the TEST environment in Region of your choice. Following creates it in ap-southeast-1.

```
copilot env init --name test --region ap-southeast-1 --default-config
```

3. Create the PROD environment in Region of your choice. Following creates it in ap-south-1. Notice the --prod flag. This is helpful to identify production environments. It is also automatically considered production when the pipeline is create in step .

```
copilot env init --name prod --region ap-south-1 --default-config --prod
```

4. Create a Service for "Users"

```
copilot svc init --dockerfile ./services/users/Dockerfile --name users --svc-type "Load Balanced Web Service"
```

5. Deploy the "Users" service in TEST environment

```
copilot svc deploy --name users --env test
```

6. Deploy the "Users" service in PRODUCTION environment

```
copilot svc deploy --name users --env prod
```

7. Use the show command to check status of your environment deployments

```
copilot svc show
```

You can repeat steps 4-7 for every new service you wish to deploy. 
Example, repeat following for the "Threads" and "Posts" services:

```
copilot svc init --dockerfile ./services/threads/Dockerfile --name threads --svc-type "Load Balanced Web Service"
copilot svc deploy --name threads --env test
copilot svc deploy --name threads --env prod
copilot svc show


copilot svc init --dockerfile ./services/posts/Dockerfile --name posts --svc-type "Load Balanced Web Service"
copilot svc deploy --name posts --env test
copilot svc deploy --name posts --env prod
copilot svc show
```

You can open each service in each environment using the URL provided in the output. Make sure to add '/api/service-name' to view each service individually.

## Deploy Release Pipeline for the Microservices Application :

```
copilot pipeline init
git add copilot/pipeline.yml copilot/buildspec.yml copilot/.workspace && git commit -m "Adding pipeline artifacts" && git push

copilot pipeline update
copilot pipeline status

```
